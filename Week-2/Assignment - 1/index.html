                    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                    and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
                    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                    included cues for the appearance of the document.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of
                    a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
                    MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                    JavaScript.[2]
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors,
                    and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
                    control in the specification of presentation characteristics.

                        React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript
                        library[3]
                        for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly
                        Facebook)
                        and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in
                        the
                        development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
                        Next.js.
                        However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so
                        creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as
                        well as
                        certain client-side functionality.

                        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on
                        the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build
                        scalable network applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line
                        tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page
                        content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a
                        "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single
                        programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
